# Texas-High-School-Dropout-Rate
Project Title: Texas High School Dropout Analysis & Prevention Strategy (2018-2023)
Objective: Reduce high school dropout rates in Texas by 1% by May 2026 through data-driven interventions.

Project Overview:
This project identifies key socioeconomic, academic, and systemic factors contributing to high school dropout rates in Texas. Leveraging data from the Texas Education Agency (TEA), we analyzed trends, performed root cause analysis, and proposed actionable strategies to improve student retention. Our work ranked 1st in class for its societal impact and methodological rigor.

Key Components:

Data Analysis: Cleaned and analyzed 5,843 rows of quantitative data (Excel, Python) to identify dropout patterns.

Regression & Visualization: Utilized Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Scikit-learn) for predictive modeling and interactive visualizations.

Key Findings:

Top Risk Factors: Economic disadvantage (2.7% dropout rate vs. 1.2% for others), lack of counseling access, low student engagement.

High-Risk Areas: Houston (Harris County: 8,500 dropouts in 2022-23) and Dallas-Fort Worth.

Solutions:

Early Warning System (EWS) for at-risk students (tracking attendance, grades).

Targeted interventions in high-risk counties, inspired by proven programs like AVID and Communities In Schools.

Methodology:

DMAIC Framework: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control.

Data Sources: TEA reports, academic research, and case studies on dropout prevention.

Tools & Technologies:

Python: Data cleaning, regression analysis, visualization.

Excel: Initial data processing and exploratory analysis.

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

Impact:

Validated strategies to address systemic barriers (e.g., economic instability, academic support).

Recognized by professors for innovative use of data science in solving real-world educational challenges.

Repository Contents:

Cleaned datasets, Jupyter notebooks for analysis/visualization.

Presentation slides, project report, and references.

Documentation of the DMAIC process and intervention plans.

Achievement: üèÜ Awarded 1st Place in class for actionable insights and impactful presentation.
